Orphan hero Lục Vân Tiên represents virtue triumphing over adversity. Song transmits core values: filial piety, gratitude, family bonds, compassion for vulnerable.",
    "linguisticProfile": "Standard Vietnamese with Southern influences (Nguyễn Đình Chiểu was from Southern Vietnam, though Lục Vân Tiên known nationwide). Uses literary vocabulary ('thác' for death) mixed with colloquial expressions ('lỡ lời'). Rich in reduplication patterns typical of Vietnamese folk poetry.",
    "performanceContext": "Sung as lullaby to young children, typically by mothers or grandmothers. Serves dual purpose: 1) Soothing child to sleep with gentle melody, 2) Teaching moral lesson about valuing parents while they're alive. Often sung during rocking, gentle swaying. Can also be performed in educational contexts (teaching Lục Vân Tiên story), cultural presentations.",
    "pedagogicalValue": "Exceptional value for teaching: 1) Vietnamese figurative language (simile, metaphor, metonymy, reduplication), 2) Cultural values (filial piety, ancestral worship, family structure), 3) Literary tradition (Nguyễn Đình Chiểu), 4) Social history (orphan vulnerability in traditional Vietnam), 5) Linguistic patterns (rhyming compounds, parallel structure), 6) Performance techniques (lullaby vocal quality, rocking rhythm). Suitable for intermediate to advanced Vietnamese learners, cultural studies, ethnomusicology, comparative literature."
