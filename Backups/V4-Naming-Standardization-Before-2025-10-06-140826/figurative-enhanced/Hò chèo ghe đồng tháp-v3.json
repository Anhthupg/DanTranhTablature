Regional identity marker for Đồng Tháp province.",

Now performed at cultural festivals, heritage events, folk music concerts. Traditional context: group of rowers in boat, one lead singer, others join vocables. Modern context: solo or ensemble stage performance, cultural preservation efforts.",

Universal phenomenon: rhythm coordinates labor, vocables mark tempo, narratives entertain during repetitive work. Vietnamese Delta Hò distinctiveness: water-based (rowing not land labor), mixture of love stories with work rhythm, regional vocables unique to Mekong Delta, endangered due to mechanization of water transport.",
    "preservationStatus": "Endangered - mechanization of Delta water transport (motorized boats replacing rowing) means traditional context vanishing. Younger generations not learning rowing vocables in authentic contexts. UNESCO recognition of Delta cultural heritage aids preservation, but practical transmission challenges remain. Active efforts: cultural centers teaching Hò, festivals showcasing tradition, documentation projects recording elder singers."
