  "collectionContext": {
    "genreClassification": "Hò cập bến (Southern Vietnamese Mekong Delta rowing song)",

    "culturalSignificance": "Representative of Southern Vietnamese river culture and Hò tradition. Endangered genre as traditional river transport declines. UNESCO intangible cultural heritage candidate. Documents Mekong Delta work song tradition with both functional (rowing coordination) and poetic/artistic dimensions.",

    "linguisticProfile": "Southern Vietnamese dialect with distinctive features: 'h' silent in pronunciation (hồng → ồng), mid-level tone (ngang) dominant for vocables. Mixes folk vocables ('Dô ta') with literary Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary ('cầm cương', 'nguyệt hồng'), showing register sophistication. Question-answer structure typical of Hò genre.",

    "performanceContext": "Traditionally performed by rowers in Mekong Delta during river transport work - fishing, rice transport, passenger ferries. Lead singer (often boat captain or senior rower) sings narrative lines, group responds with 'Dô ta' vocables while rowing in synchrony. Call-response structure coordinates physical labor and creates communal bonding. Performance requires actual or mimed rowing motions for authenticity. Contemporary performances often for cultural preservation, festivals, tourism, education.",

    "pedagogicalValue": "Excellent teaching resource for: 1) Vietnamese vocable/onomatopoeia systems 2) Southern dialect and Mekong Delta culture 3) Work song/functional music traditions 4) Register mixing (folk + literary) 5) Metaphor and poetic imagery in folk songs 6) Vietnamese cultural values (quê hương, resilience, agency) 7) Endangered musical heritage preservation 8) Communal music-making and call-response structures. Accessible entry point for non-Vietnamese learners due to repetitive vocable structure, while offering cultural depth for advanced study."
