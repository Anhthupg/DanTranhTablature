        "musicalContext": "The 5-syllable structure (lục bát's \"lục\" variant) adds weight and conclusion, often used at phrase endings. As the opening phrase, it establishes the tonal center and introduces the melodic motif that will be varied throughout. Exclamatory phrases often use sustained notes or melismatic ornaments (grace notes, bends) to heighten emotional intensity. Lullaby phrases use gentle rocking rhythm (6/8 or 9/8 meter) mirroring the physical motion of cradling a child."
