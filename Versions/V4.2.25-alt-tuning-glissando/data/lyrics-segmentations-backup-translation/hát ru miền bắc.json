Exclamatory phrases often use sustained notes or melismatic ornaments (grace notes, bends) to heighten emotional intensity. Lullaby phrases use gentle rocking rhythm (6/8 or 9/8 meter) mirroring the physical motion of cradling a child. The repetition of this refrain creates hypnotic effect and marks structural divisions between narrative verses."
