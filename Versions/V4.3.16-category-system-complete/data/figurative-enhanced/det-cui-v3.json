      "subcategory": "partial_reduplication",

      "culturalWeights": {
        "historicalDepth": 7,
        "explanation": "Weaving traditions in Vietnam date back centuries, with specialized vocabulary preserved in work songs. This reduplication pattern reflects ancient oral transmission methods where sound patterns aided memorization and rhythm maintenance during repetitive labor.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 6,
        "explanation": "While weaving was widespread throughout Vietnam, specific weaving terminology and song styles varied by region. This expression appears in Northern and Central work songs, particularly where home textile production was economically significant.",

        "symbolicLoad": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderate symbolism: the act of 'hooking' the loom represents the engagement between worker and tool, human rhythm and mechanical process. The reduplication emphasizes the cyclical, repetitive nature of weaving as both physical labor and meditative practice.",

        "ritualSignificance": 4,
        "explanation": "Work songs held some ceremonial importance in teaching contexts and communal weaving sessions, though not central to major rituals. Singing while weaving was a social practice that reinforced community bonds and transmitted technical knowledge.",

        "transmissionImportance": 7,
        "explanation": "Highly important for cultural preservation as traditional weaving rapidly declined with industrialization. These songs and their specialized vocabulary are disappearing as fewer young people learn hand-weaving, making documentation crucial.",

        "emotionalResonance": 6,
        "explanation": "Strong emotional connection for older generations who remember the rhythm of home weaving. The reduplication creates a hypnotic, meditative quality that evokes the repetitive, focused state of traditional textile work."

      "complexityMetrics": {
        "layersOfMeaning": 3,
        "explanation": "Three layers: 1) Literal action of hooking loom threads, 2) Phonetic emphasis through reduplication creating rhythmic flow, 3) Symbolic representation of worker-tool harmony and labor rhythm.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderate metaphorical mapping: PHYSICAL ACTION → RHYTHMIC PATTERN → MEDITATIVE STATE. The reduplication maps concrete weaving motion onto abstract concepts of repetition, rhythm, and focused consciousness.",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 6,
        "explanation": "Understanding requires knowledge of traditional weaving processes, the physical action of 'hooking' threads, and how work songs functioned to maintain rhythm. Non-weavers may miss the technical specificity and rhythmic function.",

        "idiomaticity": 4,
        "explanation": "Semi-fixed expression in weaving contexts, though 'mắc' alone is compositional. The reduplication 'mắc mà' is somewhat idiomatic to work songs, not freely compositional in standard Vietnamese.",

        "contextDependence": 7,
        "explanation": "Highly context-dependent: full meaning emerges only when understood as part of weaving work song, accompanying specific physical motions. Without weaving context, appears merely as grammatical variation.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderately challenging to teach: requires explaining traditional weaving process, function of work songs, and how phonetic reduplication creates rhythm. Physical demonstration of weaving motion aids comprehension."

      "culturalWeights": {
        "historicalDepth": 6,
        "explanation": "Rhyming exclamatory particles (ối, ơi, a) have ancient roots in Vietnamese folk music, serving as melodic fillers and emotional intensifiers. The specific pairing 'tay ối' reflects centuries-old practice of highlighting body parts in work songs to focus attention on physical technique.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 5,
        "explanation": "Fairly widespread across regions, though specific exclamatory particles vary (Northern: ơi, Central: ối/ơi, Southern: a/ơi). The 'ối' particle suggests Central or Central-influenced tradition.",

        "symbolicLoad": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate-to-high symbolic load: hands represent not just physical tools but the weaver's skill, livelihood, and artistic expression. The exclamation 'ối' adds emotional layer—reverence, care, or even plea to the hands to perform well.",

        "ritualSignificance": 3,
        "explanation": "Low ritual significance, though hands were sometimes blessed before important weaving projects (wedding fabrics, ceremonial textiles). The expression itself is functional rather than ceremonial.",

        "transmissionImportance": 6,

        "emotionalResonance": 7,
        "explanation": "Strong emotional resonance: elderly weavers often became emotional recalling how they sang to their hands during long weaving sessions. The 'ối' particle conveys affection, encouragement, and sometimes exhaustion or pain."

        "explanation": "Moderately idiomatic: while 'tay' (hands) is compositional, pairing with 'ối' specifically for rhythmic-emotional effect is a folk song convention not used in everyday speech in this form.",

        "contextDependence": 6,

        "historicalDepth": 6,
        "explanation": "Traditional Vietnamese craft pedagogy emphasized embodied knowledge passed through physical demonstration and metaphorical language. 'Suppleness' (mềm) as ideal hand quality appears in teaching across crafts (weaving, pottery, martial arts, calligraphy).",

        "regionalSpecificity": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderately widespread: the concept of 'soft hands' as skilled hands exists throughout Vietnam, though specific crafts emphasized it differently. Weaving particularly prized this balance of control and flexibility.",

        "symbolicLoad": 7,
        "explanation": "High symbolic load: 'supple hands' represent not just physical flexibility but broader life philosophy—strength through gentleness, control through yielding (resonates with Taoist-Confucian ideals of 柔 (nhuyễn/mềm) in Vietnamese culture).",

        "ritualSignificance": 4,
        "explanation": "Moderate ritual significance: in apprenticeship contexts, the first teaching of proper hand technique had some ceremonial quality. Elders would guide novice hands through motions, passing on skill through touch and instruction.",

        "transmissionImportance": 8,
        "explanation": "Very important for preserving traditional craft pedagogy. As hand-weaving declines, understanding of how technique was taught through embodied metaphor (not written manuals) is being lost. Documents ancient pedagogical methods.",

        "emotionalResonance": 7,
        "explanation": "Strong emotional resonance: for those who learned traditional crafts, the instruction to 'soften hands' evokes memories of teachers' guidance, the struggle to master technique, pride in developing skilled hands."
