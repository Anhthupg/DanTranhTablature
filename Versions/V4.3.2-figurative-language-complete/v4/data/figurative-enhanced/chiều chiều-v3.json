    {
      "expression": "chiều chiều",
      "type": "reduplication_idiom",
      "literal": "afternoon afternoon",
      "meaning": "late afternoon, twilight time - evocative and poetic",
      "phraseIds": [1],
      "position": "phrase_beginning",

      "culturalWeights": {
        "historicalDepth": 8,
        "explanation_historicalDepth": "This reduplication pattern dates back centuries in Vietnamese poetry and folk songs. The use of time-based reduplications to evoke atmosphere is documented in classical Vietnamese literature from the 15th-17th centuries, particularly in Lục Bát poetry and folk song traditions. The phrase carries the weight of generations of mountain travelers using this expression.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 6,
        "explanation_regionalSpecificity": "While time reduplications exist across Vietnam, 'chiều chiều' in the context of mountain walking songs is particularly associated with Central Vietnamese highland regions (Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh, Quảng Bình). The specific emotional resonance - melancholy mixed with companionship - reflects Central Vietnamese cultural attitudes toward journey and time.",

        "symbolicLoad": 7,
        "explanation_symbolicLoad": "Beyond literal time marking, 'chiều chiều' symbolizes the liminal space between day and night, work and rest, presence and absence. In Vietnamese folk tradition, twilight is when spirits move between worlds, when lovers part, when workers return home. The reduplication intensifies this symbolic weight, evoking transience, nostalgia, and the passage of time.",

        "ritualSignificance": 3,
        "explanation_ritualSignificance": "Not directly tied to rituals, but twilight time holds cultural significance for daily practices: end of work, evening prayers, family gatherings. The expression appears in songs sung during these transitional moments, lending it indirect ritual association.",

        "transmissionImportance": 7,
        "explanation_transmissionImportance": "Essential for understanding Vietnamese temporal-emotional associations. Losing this expression would diminish the cultural understanding of how Vietnamese folk tradition links time of day with emotional states. Critical for teaching Vietnamese poetic language and folk song aesthetics.",

        "emotionalResonance": 9,
        "explanation_emotionalResonance": "Extremely powerful emotional impact. For Vietnamese speakers, 'chiều chiều' immediately evokes nostalgia, melancholy, longing, and the bittersweet feeling of day's end. The reduplication amplifies this emotional charge. Performers often cite this phrase as emotionally demanding to sing authentically."

      "complexityMetrics": {
        "layersOfMeaning": 4,
        "explanation_layersOfMeaning": "Four distinct layers: (1) Literal: afternoon/twilight time, (2) Atmospheric: evocative, poetic mood, (3) Emotional: nostalgia and melancholy, (4) Symbolic: transience and liminal space. Each layer accessible to different levels of cultural familiarity.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 7,
        "explanation_crossDomainMapping": "Maps TIME (concrete) → EMOTION (abstract). The reduplication creates a metaphorical space where temporal progression becomes emotional journey. This is a sophisticated conceptual metaphor: EMOTIONAL STATES ARE TEMPORAL LOCATIONS.",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 6,
        "explanation_culturalPrerequisites": "Requires understanding: (1) Vietnamese reduplication as intensification/poeticization, (2) Cultural associations of twilight in Vietnamese tradition, (3) Mountain walking song contexts, (4) Central Vietnamese emotional expressiveness. Moderate cultural knowledge needed for full appreciation.",

        "idiomaticity": 7,
        "explanation_idiomaticity": "Highly idiomatic - the meaning is not predictable from the parts. 'chiều' + 'chiều' ≠ simply 'two afternoons' but rather creates a distinct poetic-emotional entity. The phrase is semi-frozen, though similar patterns exist (sáng sáng = early morning).",

        "contextDependence": 5,
        "explanation_contextDependence": "Moderately context-dependent. Works in multiple contexts (mountain songs, love songs, work songs), but emotional register shifts based on melodic setting, vocal tone, and co-occurring phrases. Standalone meaning accessible, but full resonance requires musical context.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 7,
        "explanation_pedagogicalChallenge": "Challenging to teach non-natives because: (1) Reduplication system unfamiliar to most languages, (2) Emotional connotations not obvious, (3) Requires cultural immersion to grasp twilight symbolism, (4) Vocal expression requires subtle emotional control. Needs extensive cultural explanation and listening examples."

      "culturalWeights": {
        "historicalDepth": 6,
        "explanation_historicalDepth": "Motion reduplications like 'trèo trèo' have been part of Vietnamese folk song tradition for centuries, particularly in songs describing nature and animal behavior. The specific application to gibbons climbing appears in folk songs documented from the 18th-19th centuries in Central Highland regions where gibbons were (and in some areas still are) present.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 7,
        "explanation_regionalSpecificity": "Strongly associated with Central Highland regions where gibbons are native (Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh, Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị). The phrase appears in mountain walking songs and forest songs from these areas. Less common in lowland or urban folk songs where gibbon imagery is absent.",

        "symbolicLoad": 5,
        "explanation_symbolicLoad": "Moderate symbolic weight. Gibbons in Vietnamese folk tradition represent freedom, agility, and connection to wild nature. 'Trèo trèo' can symbolically represent aspiration, struggle to ascend, or natural grace. However, the symbolism is less developed than some other animal metaphors (e.g., birds for love, fish for freedom).",

        "ritualSignificance": 2,
        "explanation_ritualSignificance": "Minimal ritual significance. Appears in entertainment and work songs rather than ceremonial contexts. Gibbons are not central to Vietnamese ritual life, though they hold respect as mountain spirits in some highland ethnic minority traditions.",

        "transmissionImportance": 6,
        "explanation_transmissionImportance": "Important for preserving knowledge of regional fauna and the cultural integration of natural observation into folk song. As gibbons become endangered, this expression preserves cultural memory of human-gibbon coexistence. Valuable for teaching Vietnamese motion verbs and reduplication patterns.",

        "emotionalResonance": 6,
        "explanation_emotionalResonance": "Moderate to strong emotional impact. The reduplication creates a sense of continuous motion, energy, and connection to wild nature. For listeners familiar with gibbon calls and movement, the phrase evokes vivid sensory memories and appreciation of natural beauty."

      "complexityMetrics": {
        "layersOfMeaning": 3,
        "explanation_layersOfMeaning": "Three layers: (1) Literal: gibbons climbing trees, (2) Atmospheric: continuous flowing motion, energy, (3) Symbolic: freedom and natural grace. More straightforward than deeply philosophical expressions.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 4,
        "explanation_crossDomainMapping": "Maps PHYSICAL MOTION (climbing) → EMOTIONAL/AESTHETIC QUALITY (grace, freedom, energy). Relatively simple metaphorical structure - direct observation of nature creating aesthetic impression.",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 5,
        "explanation_culturalPrerequisites": "Requires: (1) Familiarity with Vietnamese reduplication for emphasis, (2) Knowledge that gibbons exist in Vietnamese highlands, (3) Understanding of folk song's observational nature. Moderate cultural background needed, but gibbon motion is visually accessible even to outsiders.",

        "idiomaticity": 5,
        "explanation_idiomaticity": "Moderately idiomatic. The reduplication follows productive pattern in Vietnamese (verb + verb = emphatic/continuous action), but the specific 'trèo trèo' in context of gibbons has become somewhat lexicalized in highland folk song tradition.",

        "contextDependence": 6,
        "explanation_contextDependence": "Fairly context-dependent. Meaning shifts based on whether describing gibbons (literal), humans climbing (metaphorical effort), or abstract ascension (symbolic). Musical setting and surrounding phrases guide interpretation.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 5,
        "explanation_pedagogicalChallenge": "Moderately challenging. Students need to understand: (1) Reduplication system, (2) Vietnamese motion verb semantics, (3) Gibbon behavior and cultural associations. Visual aids (videos of gibbons) and motion demonstrations help significantly."

        "symbolicLoad": 6,
        "explanation_symbolicLoad": "Moderate to high symbolic weight. 'Tà' can evoke 'tà áo' (flap of garment), suggesting flowing movement, while 'là' resonates with 'lá' (leaf), evoking natural imagery.

  "collectionContext": {
    "genreClassification": "Mountain Walking Song (Hò Miền Núi)",
    "subgenre": "Journey/Nature Observation Song",
    "culturalSignificance": "This song represents the living tradition of Central Vietnamese Highland folk music, documenting the cultural practices of mountain travelers and their integration with natural environment. The song preserves both linguistic features (reduplications, vocables, regional dialect) and cultural knowledge (highland fauna, time-emotion associations). While not UNESCO-listed, it exemplifies the cultural heritage that such designations aim to protect.",

    "linguisticProfile": "Central Vietnamese dialect with characteristic features: (1) Vocable 'tà là' (regional marker), (2) Poetic reduplications, (3) Nature-based vocabulary ('vượn' = gibbon, 'đèo' = mountain pass), (4) Exclamatory particles ('ơi', 'hỡi'). The song demonstrates the musical-linguistic integration typical of Vietnamese folk song where tone, melody, and meaning are inseparable.",

    "performanceContext": "Traditionally sung by individuals or small groups during mountain journeys, work in highland fields, or evening gatherings. The walking rhythm embedded in the melody helped maintain steady pace during travel. Today performed in folk music preservation contexts, cultural festivals, and educational settings. Still occasionally sung by older generation in rural Central Vietnam.",

    "pedagogicalValue": "Excellent teaching material for: (1) Vietnamese reduplication system, (2) Vocable tradition and regional variation, (3) Tonal pronunciation in musical context, (4) Cultural-environmental knowledge integration, (5) Folk song structure and performance practice. The song's moderate length and clear structure make it accessible while the figurative expressions provide rich content for cultural-linguistic analysis.",

    "ecosystemAndBiodiversity": "The song documents historical presence of gibbons in Central Vietnamese highlands, providing cultural evidence of biodiversity now threatened. The vivid description of gibbon behavior ('trèo trèo') preserves traditional ecological knowledge. This makes the song valuable for both cultural preservation and environmental awareness education.",

    "emotionalLandscape": "The song creates an emotional journey from melancholic twilight departure ('chiều chiều') through energetic nature observation ('trèo trèo', bird calls) to contemplative breathing space ('tà là'). This emotional architecture reflects the psychological experience of mountain travel - solitude mixed with wonder at natural beauty, transitional states, companionship, and connection to wild landscape."
