        "explanation": "Traditional Vietnamese proverb imagery dating back several centuries, passed through oral tradition in folk songs and sayings. Not ancient (pre-1000 CE) but well-established in Vietnamese cultural consciousness.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 3,
        "explanation": "Widely used across Vietnam in various contexts (proverbs, folk songs, everyday speech). Not region-specific; found in Northern, Central, and Southern traditions with minimal variation.",

        "symbolicLoad": 8,
        "explanation": "Rich symbolic meaning with multiple layers: (1) Small creature (humility/ordinary person), (2) Difficult task (rope climbing), (3) Rarity of success (only in special times). Represents human aspiration against odds.",

        "ritualSignificance": 2,
        "explanation": "Not used in formal rituals or ceremonies. Appears in folk songs and casual speech. No prescribed ceremonial role, though may appear in work songs or rowing songs as philosophical reflection.",

        "transmissionImportance": 6,
        "explanation": "Important for preserving Vietnamese folk wisdom and metaphorical thinking. Teaches values of persistence and acknowledging difficulty. Valuable for cultural continuity but not essential for survival.",

        "emotionalResonance": 6,
        "explanation": "Evokes feelings of empathy (for the struggling ant), hope (achievement is possible), and realism (acknowledging rarity). Moderate emotional impact - contemplative rather than intensely moving."

        "crossDomainMapping": 7,
        "explanation": "Maps from ANIMAL BEHAVIOR (concrete) → HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT (abstract). Specific mappings: ant's small size → human limitations, rope → obstacle/challenge, climbing → striving/effort, rare success → exceptional circumstances required.",

        "idiomaticity": 5,
        "explanation": "Semi-fixed expression. 'Con kiến leo dây' can stand alone but often paired with 'ngộ kỳ thời' (rare times). Components are meaningful individually but together create stronger idiomatic force. Somewhat compositional but conventionalized.",

        "contextDependence": 6,
        "explanation": "Meaning clarified significantly by context. In this song, 'ngộ kỳ thời' (rare times) frames it as exceptional circumstance. In isolation, could refer to any difficult task. Context specifies: meeting the beloved is the 'rare achievement.'",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderately challenging for non-Vietnamese learners. Requires: (1) Understanding Vietnamese animal symbolism, (2) Grasping metaphorical extension, (3) Recognizing folk song conventions. Not extremely difficult but not transparent either."

        "explanation": "Extremely high symbolic weight: (1) Connection to Buddhist Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha), (2) Spiritual protection during journey, (3) Syncretism of sacred and secular, (4) Invocation of karmic merit. Represents Vietnamese religious synthesis.",

        "emotionalResonance": 8,

        "explanation": "Rhyming reduplication ('tổng X tổng Y') is traditional Vietnamese folk song technique dating back several centuries. Specific names 'Di' and 'Dương' may reference historical figures or place names in local tradition. Moderate historical depth - documented in folk song collections but not ancient.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 7,
        "explanation": "Likely regional specificity - 'Di' and 'Dương' may be local ancestor names, village spirits, or geographical references known in specific area. Generic reduplication pattern is nationwide, but specific names suggest local cultural knowledge.",

        "explanation": "Symbolic meanings: (1) Ancestral connection to land, (2) Sacred geography (spirit-protected place), (3) Legitimacy of meeting place (blessed by ancestors), (4) Poetic euphony. Links personal meeting to spiritual landscape.",

        "ritualSignificance": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderate ritual significance - invokes ancestors/spirits of place (tổng = ancestor/chief), suggesting spiritual sanction for the meeting. Not core ritual text but serves protective/blessing function. May relate to village guardian spirits.",

        "explanation": "Important for preserving: (1) Local ancestral/geographical knowledge, (2) Rhyming reduplication technique in Vietnamese folk songs, (3) Connection between place, ancestors, and human activity. Moderate importance for cultural continuity.",

        "idiomaticity": 6,
        "explanation": "Semi-idiomatic. The reduplication pattern 'tổng X tổng Y' is formulaic (poetic technique), but specific content (Di, Dương) may be compositional or specific to this song/region. Mixture of fixed pattern and variable content.",
