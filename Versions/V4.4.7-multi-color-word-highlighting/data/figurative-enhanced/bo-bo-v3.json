        "historicalDepth": 8,
        "explanation": "Vietnamese work songs (hò) with rhythmic vocables date back centuries (estimated 500-1000 years), predating written musical notation. These vocable patterns were orally transmitted across generations as essential tools for coordinating agricultural labor. Ancient practice documented in colonial-era ethnographic studies (early 1900s) showing continuity from pre-modern times.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 6,
        "explanation": "Widespread across Vietnamese regions (Northern, Central, Southern) but with phonetic variations. 'Tềnh tang' pattern is characteristic of Northern work songs, while Southern regions use 'teng tàng' or 'đeng đàng'. Not unique to one village/region but Vietnamese-specific (not found in Chinese or other Southeast Asian work songs with this exact pattern).",

        "symbolicLoad": 7,
        "explanation": "Rich multi-layered symbolism: (1) Sound mimics physical tools (hoes striking earth, carrying poles creaking), (2) Rhythm symbolizes collective unity and social cohesion, (3) Vocables represent oral tradition and pre-literate knowledge transmission, (4) Non-lexical sounds symbolize transcendence of verbal communication into pure embodied coordination.",

        "ritualSignificance": 5,
        "explanation": "Not strictly ritual but functionally ceremonial in labor context. Work songs with vocables were performed at specific agricultural moments (planting, harvesting), creating quasi-ritual structure. Sometimes incorporated into festivals celebrating harvest. Moderately significant in traditional agricultural ceremonies but not as essential as religious ritual music.",

        "transmissionImportance": 8,
        "explanation": "Very important for preserving oral music tradition and collective work culture. As mechanized agriculture replaces manual labor, vocable-based work songs face extinction. Preserving these patterns maintains knowledge of: (1) traditional labor coordination, (2) oral musical pedagogy, (3) community bonding through song, (4) non-lexical musical communication systems unique to Vietnamese culture.",

        "emotionalResonance": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate to strong emotional impact. For older Vietnamese who remember collective farming, evokes powerful nostalgia and sense of lost community. For younger audiences, represents cultural heritage and rural identity. Creates feelings of solidarity, rhythmic pleasure, and connection to ancestral labor traditions. Not as emotionally charged as love songs or lullabies but deeply meaningful in social context."
      },

      "complexityMetrics": {
        "layersOfMeaning": 3,
        "explanation": "Three distinct layers: (1) Literal/acoustic - pure sound pattern for rhythm, (2) Functional - tool sound imitation and labor coordination device, (3) Cultural-symbolic - represents oral tradition, collective identity, and traditional agricultural worldview where work is communal and song-integrated.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 7,
        "explanation": "Complex multi-domain mapping: SOUND → TOOL FUNCTION (vocables mimic hoe strikes), RHYTHM → LABOR COORDINATION (beat synchronizes movements), SONG → SOCIAL BONDING (collective singing creates community). Embodies conceptual metaphor: COLLECTIVE LABOR IS MUSICAL PERFORMANCE - work becomes rhythmic art, workers become ensemble.",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 6,
        "explanation": "Significant cultural knowledge helpful: (1) understanding Vietnamese communal farming traditions (công điền system), (2) familiarity with manual agricultural tools and their sounds, (3) knowledge of work song genre (hò) in Vietnamese music, (4) awareness of oral transmission culture, (5) recognition of vocables' function in world music traditions. Appreciable without deep knowledge but full significance requires cultural context.",

        "idiomaticity": 8,
        "explanation": "Highly idiomatic and fixed. 'Tềnh tang' pattern cannot be randomly substituted or paraphrased - specific phonetic sequence is required for rhythmic and onomatopoeic function. Frozen expression in work song tradition. Not compositional - you can't replace 'tềnh' with synonym because it has no semantic meaning, only sonic/rhythmic function.",

        "contextDependence": 7,
        "explanation": "Highly context-dependent. Without work song performance context, could seem like gibberish. Full meaning emerges only in: (1) agricultural labor setting (or its representation), (2) with understanding of vocable function, (3) with rhythmic/musical framing, (4) with knowledge that it coordinates physical movements. Meaningless as isolated text.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 5,
        "explanation": "Moderate challenge to teach. Easier than highly cultural expressions because: (1) similar to vocables/scat singing in other cultures (universal concept), (2) no semantic content to memorize, (3) rhythmic pattern easy to learn. Harder because: (1) requires explaining non-lexical singing (unfamiliar to some), (2) onomatopoeia doesn't translate across languages, (3) labor context may be unfamiliar to urbanized students."

          "Collective work system (công điền) had complex political history: traditional village cooperation, but also exploited under colonialism and collectivization. Be aware of political layers",
          "As manual agriculture disappears, this represents vanishing lifeways. Honor as cultural heritage worth preserving, not archaic practice to mock",

          "STEP 3: Discuss vocables vs. lyrics. Why non-lexical? (1) Easy for anyone to learn/join, (2) No language barrier in multilingual crews, (3) Focuses on rhythm not meaning, (4) Breath control (singing while working is hard - simple syllables easier).",
          "STEP 4: Practice rhythm separately from meaning. Clap/stomp 'tềnh tang tềnh tang' pattern until internalized. Feel the work rhythm in body.",
          "STEP 5: Connect to tool sounds. If possible, demonstrate hoe striking earth, have students listen to sound. Can they hear 'tềnh tang' in the tool? Onomatopoeia exercise.",

      "occurrences": 1,

      "culturalWeights": {
        "historicalDepth": 8,
        "explanation": "Ancient courtship metaphor dating back centuries in Vietnamese folk poetry (ca dao) and music. Documented in pre-colonial literature (Truyện Kiều, 19th century, uses bridge metaphors for romantic connection). Likely predates written records, part of oral courtship song tradition (estimated 500+ years). Bridges themselves symbolically significant in Vietnamese culture since ancient times (crossing water = life transition).",

        "regionalSpecificity": 5,
        "explanation": "Widespread across Vietnamese-speaking regions (North, Central, South) with minor variations. Not unique to one locality but distinctly Vietnamese. Similar bridge courtship metaphors exist in other East Asian cultures (Chinese: 搭桥 dāqiáo), but Vietnamese version has culture-specific nuances (related to rural village life, river crossings, wooden bridges). Pan-Vietnamese but with regional variations.",

        "symbolicLoad": 9,
        "explanation": "Extremely rich multi-layered symbolism: (1) PHYSICAL BRIDGE = ROMANTIC CONNECTION (infrastructure as relationship), (2) MAN BUILDING = MALE INITIATIVE/AGENCY in courtship, (3) WOMAN CROSSING = FEMININE MOVEMENT toward relationship, (4) RIVER/OBSTACLE = SOCIAL BARRIERS (family objections, class differences), (5) WOOD PLANKS (ván mong) = MATERIAL RESOURCES man must possess, (6) BRIDGE as MEETING PLACE = LIMINAL SPACE for forbidden romance, (7) CROSSING WATER = LIFE TRANSITION/COMMITMENT. Densely symbolic.",

        "ritualSignificance": 4,
        "explanation": "Not strictly ritual but ceremonially significant in traditional courtship process. Courtship songs containing this metaphor were performed at specific occasions (village festivals, market days, harvest celebrations) where young people could interact. Bridges were actual sites of romantic meetings in rural Vietnam (semi-ritualized space). Moderate ceremonial importance in courtship customs.",

        "transmissionImportance": 7,
        "explanation": "Important for preserving traditional courtship culture and gender role understanding. As modern dating replaces traditional rural courtship, metaphors like 'bắc cầu' become opaque to younger generations. Maintaining this expression preserves knowledge of: (1) historical gender dynamics, (2) rural infrastructure's role in social life, (3) metaphorical thinking in Vietnamese culture, (4) evolution of romantic ideals.",

        "emotionalResonance": 8,
        "explanation": "Strong emotional impact - evokes tenderness, romantic longing, male protective desire, and nostalgia for traditional courtship. For Vietnamese familiar with folk songs, immediately recognizable as romantic offer. Creates feelings of: chivalry, devotion, anticipation, gentle courtship (not aggressive). Emotionally resonant across age groups who value traditional romance."

        "layersOfMeaning": 4,
        "explanation": "Four interpretive layers: (1) Literal - actual bridge construction, (2) Practical - helping woman cross water, (3) Metaphorical - creating romantic connection between two people, (4) Social-symbolic - overcoming familial/social barriers to marriage. Can be read at multiple levels simultaneously.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 8,
        "explanation": "Complex abstract mapping: PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (bridge) → SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP (romance). Subsidiary mappings: CONSTRUCTION → COURTSHIP EFFORT, WATER/OBSTACLE → SOCIAL BARRIERS, CROSSING → COMMITMENT, BUILDER → MASCULINE AGENCY, CROSSER → FEMININE ACCEPTANCE. Embodies conceptual metaphor: LOVE IS A JOURNEY (requires bridges to cross obstacles).",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 7,
        "explanation": "Significant cultural knowledge required for full appreciation: (1) Vietnamese rural village geography (rivers separating communities), (2) Historical lack of permanent bridges (wooden temporary structures), (3) Gender roles in traditional courtship (male initiative), (4) Importance of family approval in marriage, (5) Bridge as meeting place for young couples, (6) Economic implications (planks as valuable resource). Context-heavy metaphor.",

        "idiomaticity": 8,
        "explanation": "Highly idiomatic and fixed. 'Bắc cầu' cannot be paraphrased (e.g., 'xây cầu' = build bridge grammatically, but not idiomatic for courtship). Frozen expression in romantic register. Semi-compositional (can understand elements 'build' + 'bridge') but full romantic meaning is non-compositional (must learn culturally).",

        "contextDependence": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderately context-dependent. In isolation, could be literal bridge-building. Romantic meaning clear in: (1) courtship song context, (2) when man speaks to woman, (3) with pronoun 'anh' (I/boyfriend), (4) followed by romantic content. Context disambiguates literal vs. metaphorical reading.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate-to-challenging to teach non-Vietnamese: (1) Metaphor is culturally specific (bridges don't have same courtship associations in all cultures), (2) Gender roles may seem outdated/problematic (male agency, female passivity), (3) Requires explaining rural Vietnamese infrastructure, (4) Nuances of 'ván mong' (precious planks) need economic context. Relatively accessible compared to deeper idioms, but needs substantial cultural framing."

        "historicalDepth": 7,
        "explanation": "Part of long-standing courtship song tradition where woman's vulnerability creates opportunity for male gallantry (estimated 200-500 years in oral tradition). Reflects historical realities of rural Vietnam: women often did need assistance crossing rivers/streams due to: (1) restrictive clothing (áo dài difficult to manage in water), (2) social taboos against women being alone in liminal/dangerous spaces, (3) physical challenges (floods, deep water, slippery stones). Cultural memory of genuine gender-based vulnerability.",

        "regionalSpecificity": 6,
        "explanation": "Widespread in Vietnamese courtship songs across regions but with variations. 'Em sang' (you cross) pattern is Northern/Central; Southern songs might use 'em đi' (you go) or 'em qua' (you cross over). Pan-Vietnamese concept (woman needing help) but specific phrasing is regionally variable. Distinctly Vietnamese in cultural embedding (river crossings, gender dynamics).",

        "symbolicLoad": 8,
        "explanation": "Dense symbolic content: (1) CROSSING WATER = LIFE TRANSITION/RISK, (2) WOMAN'S INABILITY = SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS on feminine autonomy, (3) NEEDING HELP = INTERDEPENDENCE in courtship (not independent modern dating), (4) RIVER as BOUNDARY = Social distance between lovers (different villages, families, classes), (5) PHYSICAL BARRIER = METAPHOR for social/familial obstacles to marriage, (6) VERB 'SANG' (cross over) = Moving from single to coupled state. Highly symbolic.",

        "ritualSignificance": 3,
        "explanation": "Minimal ritual significance but ceremonially embedded in courtship song performance contexts. River crossings themselves had quasi-ritual elements in traditional society (offerings to river spirits, auspicious times to cross). Courtship songs were performed at festivals (village fairs, harvest) where young people met. Low ritual importance but embedded in broader ceremonial courtship culture.",

        "transmissionImportance": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderately important for understanding historical gender dynamics and courtship culture. As gender roles evolve and modern infrastructure (permanent bridges, roads) eliminates physical crossing challenges, this metaphor becomes archaic. Preserving 'em sang' maintains cultural memory of: (1) historical women's constraints, (2) evolution of gender relations, (3) how geography shaped romance, (4) interdependence in pre-modern courtship.",

        "emotionalResonance": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate emotional impact. For traditional audiences, evokes: feminine vulnerability, romantic anticipation (will man help?), dramatic tension (obstacle to overcome). For modern feminist-aware audiences, may create discomfort (feminine helplessness trope). Emotional resonance depends on listener's perspective on gender roles. Nostalgia vs. critique."

        "layersOfMeaning": 3,
        "explanation": "Three layers: (1) Literal - woman physically crossing water, (2) Practical - woman needing assistance due to real obstacle, (3) Symbolic - metaphor for woman approaching relationship/marriage but facing barriers that require male help to overcome. Literal, functional, and metaphorical simultaneously.",

        "crossDomainMapping": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate metaphorical complexity: PHYSICAL CROSSING → SOCIAL/ROMANTIC TRANSITION. Subsidiary mappings: RIVER → SOCIAL BARRIER, INABILITY TO CROSS → NEED FOR MALE ASSISTANCE, CROSSING SUCCESSFULLY → ACHIEVING RELATIONSHIP. Embodies: RELATIONSHIPS REQUIRE CROSSING OBSTACLES, with gendered dimension (woman as crosser, man as enabler).",

        "culturalPrerequisites": 7,
        "explanation": "Significant cultural knowledge needed: (1) Vietnamese rural geography (prevalence of rivers/streams), (2) Historical women's clothing and mobility restrictions, (3) Gender norms in traditional courtship (female modesty, male assistance), (4) Social barriers to marriage (family approval, class matching), (5) Symbolism of water/boundaries in Vietnamese culture. Context-heavy for full appreciation.",

        "idiomaticity": 5,
        "explanation": "Semi-idiomatic. 'Em sang' is comprehensible compositionally (you + cross = you cross), but in courtship song context, carries idiomatic weight (conventionally signals feminine helplessness motif). More transparent than fully frozen idioms but still conventionalized in romantic discourse. Compositional with idiomatic overtones.",

        "contextDependence": 7,
        "explanation": "Highly context-dependent. 'Em sang' alone could mean various things (you cross the room, you move over). Romantic/helplessness meaning clear only in: (1) courtship song context, (2) following man's bridge offer ('bắc cầu'), (3) with phrase continuation 'chẳng được rằng' (can't quite manage), (4) in dramatic problem-solution narrative. Context essential.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 7,
        "explanation": "Challenging to teach, especially to modern/feminist-aware audiences: (1) Feminine helplessness trope may seem regressive, (2) Requires explaining historical gender constraints without endorsing them, (3) Physical vulnerability (river crossing) unfamiliar to students with modern infrastructure, (4) Negotiating between appreciating cultural tradition and critiquing gender ideology.

'Bồng' (carry in arms tenderly) appears in classical Vietnamese literature (Truyện Kiều, 19th century) and earlier folk poetry. Physical carrying as romantic intimacy predates modern dating - one of few socially acceptable ways for unmarried couple to touch. Historical significance as culturally sanctioned pre-marital physical contact.",

Northern 'bồng' (carry in arms), Central/Southern might use 'ẵm' (hold/carry) or 'cõng' (piggyback - though less romantic). Pan-Vietnamese concept (man carries woman across water) but specific verb 'bồng' most common in Northern folk songs. Distinctly Vietnamese in cultural connotations (tenderness, not just functionality).",

        "historicalDepth": 8,
        "explanation": "Collective agricultural system (công điền) in Vietnamese villages dates back centuries (estimated 500-1000+ years), predating French colonialism. Traditional village land management included communal fields worked cooperatively. Historical records from Lê Dynasty (15th-18th centuries) document collective farming practices. Colonial ethnographers (early 1900s) described công điền system in detail. Ancient tradition with continuous practice until mid-20th century collectivization.",

        "explanation": "Strongly Vietnamese-specific. While collective agriculture exists in other East Asian cultures (Chinese 公田 gōngtián = public fields, Korean 共田), Vietnamese 'luống công' has unique features: (1) raised bed (luống) technique for monsoon flooding, (2) specific village-level organization, (3) embedded in Vietnamese folk song tradition. Not unique to one region (found North/Central/South) but distinctly Vietnamese cultural practice.",

        "symbolicLoad": 8,
        "explanation": "Densely symbolic: (1) SHARED ROWS = COLLECTIVE FATE (what happens to crops affects whole village), (2) COMMUNAL OWNERSHIP ('công' = public/collective) = SOCIAL EQUALITY ideal, (3) WORKING TOGETHER = VILLAGE SOLIDARITY, (4) AGRICULTURAL RESULTS = SOCIAL COHESION quality, (5) 'TA' (we/our) = COLLECTIVE IDENTITY marker, (6) LUỐNG (rows) = ORDERLY ORGANIZATION of social cooperation. Embodies core Vietnamese village values: cooperation, interdependence, shared responsibility.",

        "ritualSignificance": 6,
        "explanation": "Moderate-to-significant ritual importance. Collective farming involved ceremonial elements: prayers before planting communal fields, harvest festivals celebrating collective yields, ritual division of crops among villagers. Not sacred ritual music but embedded in agricultural ceremonial calendar. Village ceremonies marked transitions in công điền cycle (planting, weeding, harvesting).",

        "transmissionImportance": 9,
        "explanation": "Critical for cultural-historical preservation. Collective farming system largely disappeared after: (1) French colonial exploitation of labor, (2) 1950s-1970s collectivization (North Vietnam), (3) Doi Moi economic reforms (1986) privatizing agriculture. Modern Vietnamese have no direct experience of traditional công điền. Preserving 'luống công ta' in folk songs maintains memory of: (1) pre-modern village organization, (2) collective agricultural knowledge, (3) social cooperation ideals, (4) alternative to individualist capitalism. Essential cultural-historical documentation.",

        "emotionalResonance": 7,
        "explanation": "Strong emotional resonance, especially for older Vietnamese who remember collective farming (whether traditional công điền or socialist collectives).

        "culturalPrerequisites": 8,

Highly context-dependent, requires historical and socio-economic knowledge.",

        "idiomaticity": 6,

        "contextDependence": 7,
        "explanation": "Highly context-dependent. 'Luống công ta' requires context to distinguish: (1) Literal (our physical rows), (2) Metonymic (our collective agricultural system), (3) Symbolic (our shared community fate). Work song context clarifies meaning. Without agricultural setting, could be opaque. Historical knowledge of công điền needed for full significance.",

        "pedagogicalChallenge": 8,
        "explanation": "Very challenging to teach non-Vietnamese: (1) Requires extensive historical background (công điền system unfamiliar), (2) Agricultural terminology ('luống' = raised bed, not common knowledge), (3) Political complexity (collective farming politically loaded - socialist associations), (4) Distinguishing traditional commons from modern socialism, (5) Economic systems concepts (collective ownership), (6) Vietnamese cultural values (cooperation vs. individualism).

          "❌ 'Less important than full phrases' → ✅ Equally important - refrain creates participatory structure that makes work songs communal. Without refrains, just solo narration. Refrain = collective essence.",
          "❌ 'Can skip refrain to save time' → ✅ Refrain is structural core - removing destroys call-response pattern and participatory nature. Essential, not optional.",
          "❌ 'Individual can sing refrain alone' → ✅ Refrain requires group - point is collective utterance. Solo refrain misses entire function (communal participation)."

    "culturalSignificance": "Exceptional example of thematic integration in Vietnamese folk music: combines labor coordination vocables (tềnh tang), romantic courtship metaphors (bridge-building, carrying beloved), and collective agricultural symbolism (communal rows). Represents full spectrum of rural Vietnamese life: individual romance nested within communal labor context. Demonstrates how personal and collective spheres integrate in traditional culture.",

    "linguisticProfile": "Northern Vietnamese with characteristic features: (1) Work song vocables 'tềnh tang' (Northern phonetics), (2) Pronouns 'anh/em' (Northern romantic register), (3) Collective pronoun 'ta' (Northern village collective marker), (4) Rhetorical question structure typical of Northern hò (work songs). Mixed lexicon: non-lexical vocables + romantic semantic content + agricultural terminology. Phonologically Northern (tones: heavy use of huyền falling, ngang level, sắc rising).",

    "performanceContext": "Dual performance contexts: (1) AGRICULTURAL: sung during collective planting/hoeing in village communal fields (công điền), coordinating labor while telling romantic story. Vocables synchronize work, narrative provides entertainment. (2) RECREATIONAL: sung at village festivals, market days, harvest celebrations where young people gathered. Could serve courtship function (young man singing to young woman). Work song in fields, courtship song at festivals. Flexible context.",

    "regionalContext": "Northern Vietnam, primarily Red River Delta agricultural regions: Bắc Ninh, Bắc Giang, Hà Nam, Nam Định, Thái Bình provinces. Areas characterized by: intensive wet rice agriculture, dense village networks, strong công điền traditions, rich hò (work song) heritage.
