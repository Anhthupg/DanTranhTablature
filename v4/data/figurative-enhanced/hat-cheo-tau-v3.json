    "performanceContext": "Historically performed during actual boat rowing on rivers and canals, synchronized with physical labor. Call-and-response pattern between lead singer and rowing crew. Now performed in cultural preservation contexts, festivals, and traditional music concerts. Originally outdoor, communal, functional music now adapted for stage performance.",
    "pedagogicalValue": "Excellent teaching example for: (1) Vietnamese reduplication patterns and their multiple functions, (2) Work song genre and communal labor traditions, (3) Particle system and vocative expressions, (4) Relationship between music and physical labor, (5) Cultural change and tradition preservation. Relatively short and simple structure makes it accessible for learners, while cultural depth provides rich discussion opportunities. Valuable for comparative ethnomusicology (vs. sea shanties, field hollers, etc.).",
    "historicalContext": "Represents centuries of Vietnamese river culture in Red River Delta and coastal regions. Boat songs coordinated rowing, eased labor, and built social bonds among transport workers. Genre declined with motorization in mid-20th century but preserved through cultural revival movements. Reflects transition from traditional to modern Vietnam.",
    "musicalCharacteristics": "Simple, repetitive melodic structure designed for work synchronization. Moderate tempo matching rowing pace. Pentatonic scale typical of Vietnamese folk music. Heavy use of refrain with 'khoan khoan hỡi hò' creating rhythmic anchor. Question-answer lyric structure (festival timing question → answer) framing the rowing refrain."
